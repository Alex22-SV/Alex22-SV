I'm Alexander from El Salvador, and I like to create programs, mostly websites but I've also developed Discord bots in the past. I'm interested on working on new and innovative projects. I can work alone and with teams. My native language is Spanish but I can fluently speak and understand English. In my free time I like to play videogames (mostly CoD and Rocket League) but also listen to Lofi music.

Skills: JS / HTML / CSS

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any web development projects and maybe Discord bots too 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
